# Cancer Drug Response Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms

Using metabolomics profiles of 927 cell lines and their corresponding drug response data to 328 drugs, machine learning algorithms are used in order to classify each cell line as a responder or non-responder to a particular drug

The main objective of this research is to improve personalized cancer therapy using machine learning algorithms.

### Dataset information

We are going to use 3 datasets, Metabolomics dataset, metadata and drug response data. These datasets are publicly available from DepMap portal (Cancer Dependency Map) and can be downloaded from the following link: https://depmap.org/portal/

1. Metabolomics dataset - contains metabolomic profiles of 927 cell lines.
2. Metadata - contains metadata of the cell lines in the metabolomics dataset and includes information like the age, sex and lineage of the cancer.
3. Drug Response Data - contains the drug response values of the cancer cell lines.

### Setup

1. We are going to use Jyputer Notebooks are our workstation - can be downloaded from Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
2. The following packages are required for the machine learning models:
  1. Numpy
     
  2. Pandas
     
  3. Scikit-learn
     
  4. Matplotlib
     
  5. Seaborn
     
3. These packages are already installed via Anaconda otherwise the attached codes can be run in order to install the packages.
